			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Much of the purpose, in my personal opinion, is to bring together a diverse range of users to one common ground where every individual’s voice is genuinely heard, valued, and given equal importance within the community. At Takalot, we strive to achieve this goal by fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and empowered to share their thoughts and perspectives, regardless of background or status. We believe that by embracing the ideas of those who came before us—the innovators, thinkers, and visionaries—we can identify what is already effective and build upon those foundations with respect and intention. Through this strategic approach, we can save valuable time and resources by avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel and can instead channel our energy into creating a meaningful, engaging, and impactful user experience. Our focus is on producing a platform that encourages collaboration, creativity, and connection, ensuring that every user can contribute to and benefit from a vibrant, respectful, and forward-thinking community.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The targeted audience for this social platform is those who seek to stay connected with their friends and family without being subjected to invasive data collection practices by large corporations or agencies that aim to market products to you or profit from selling your private data to third parties. This platform is designed for individuals who value their privacy and wish to share their lives without being tracked, analyzed, or treated as a product. The focus is to keep your social interactions personal and private while ensuring that your data remains entirely yours, free from hidden data harvesting and advertising manipulation. Our business model is structured to thrive on personal donations and community support rather than on selling user information, ensuring that we can continue to provide a secure, respectful, and genuinely private environment for your online social life.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Much of the use of JavaScript on this site is dedicated to completing simple yet essential tasks that are necessary for the smooth and engaging operation of any social media platform. One of the primary functions it serves is allowing each user to set and customize their preferred theme for their web viewing experience, giving them the ability to tailor the look and feel of the platform to match their personal taste and comfort. This ensures that users can enjoy a browsing environment that feels uniquely theirs, whether that involves dark mode for easier night viewing or personalized accent colors to make their space feel welcoming. Another significant function of JavaScript on this site is to enable users to input and post their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in real time, allowing them to share updates with their friends, family, and the wider community. This interactive functionality makes communication and connection possible on the platform, transforming it from a static page into a lively and responsive environment where users can express themselves freely, engage in meaningful conversations, and actively participate in a dynamic online social experience.</p>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page]</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the subpage]</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The Home page is where the user will see posts, updates, and shared moments made by their friends and family, allowing them to stay connected and engaged with the lives of those who matter most to them on a daily basis. It serves as a central hub where users can effortlessly scroll through a feed of photos, messages, and life updates, keeping them informed about birthdays, celebrations, achievements, and everyday moments within their circle. It is also the place where users have the opportunity to share their own thoughts, feelings, and personal experiences with others, whether it is through text posts, photos, or videos, fostering an environment of communication, support, and interaction. By providing a space where users can both view the lives of others and express themselves, the Home page becomes a vital part of the platform’s mission to create a vibrant, personal, and meaningful social experience for everyone involved, ensuring that each visit to the platform feels warm, welcoming, and purpose-driven.

			<h3>Profile</h3>
			<p>
				This may be fairly self-explanatory, but the Profile page is the dedicated space where a user can view and manage their personal profile, allowing them to see how they appear to others within the platform’s community. On this page, users can review the list of posts they have made, whether they are text updates, photos, or videos, creating a personal timeline that reflects their thoughts, feelings, and experiences over time. Additionally, the Profile page also displays any posts the user has shared from other users, allowing them to easily revisit content that they found meaningful or wanted to amplify within their network. Beyond simply displaying posts, the Profile page serves as a personal hub where users can manage their bio, profile picture, and other details that help them express who they are, creating a digital space that feels uniquely theirs. By bringing together their own content and shared moments in one organized and accessible place, the Profile page helps users reflect on their journey within the platform, maintain their digital presence, and engage with their past posts whenever they wish, ensuring their online experience remains personal and organized.
